On this first week I have started to work with [Visual Circuit](https://jderobot.github.io/VisualCircuit/). For this, I need to install [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic).

**ROS Noetic**. Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications.

**Visual Circuit**. Visual Circuit is a web platform with a visual editor that works with block based programming to develop software aplications and also robotic aplications. It is built based on [IceStudio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/icestudio).

To learn how the platform works, I've programmed some simple circuits, for example the one shown in the next image, where u receive an image from a webcam and show it in a screen.
