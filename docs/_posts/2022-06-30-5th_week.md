On the fifth week my partners had already fixed the problem with the wires, so I was able to finish properly the laser block.
Also they changed some things on how the blocks work. Now they dont use wires for some things like "frequency" and also they dont need to code 
all that frequency part, it is written on the general block code (other blocks import this code) instead of on every block.

All this forced me to update the blocks I already had ([laser](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2022-tfg-david-tapiador/new_blocks/ROS2/laser/laserROS2_new_format.py) & [cam](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2022-tfg-david-tapiador/new_blocks/ROS2/camera/CameraROS2_new_format.py) with ROS2) to the new versions of blocks, as well as the auxiliar blocks to test them ([laser data printer](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2022-tfg-david-tapiador/new_blocks/ROS2/laser/laser_data_printer_new_format.py)).

Also this week I continued making new blocks! This time I worked on the [motor driver with ROS2](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2022-tfg-david-tapiador/new_blocks/ROS2/motor/MotorROS2.py). This block receives a string array with 6 floats (linear x/y/z & angular x/y/z), for the turtlebot example only 2 of them are used (linear x and angular z), but in case other robots have other type of movements, the block accepts the 6 options.

To test the block, I created a [velocity sender block](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2022-tfg-david-tapiador/new_blocks/ROS2/motor/Vel_sender.py). It is a simple block that sends that string array with the different velocities.

Here is an example of the block working:

As I said before, my partners on the VisualCircuit project improved the block and wires connection, so I had to update the blocks. This obviously also affected the [motor driver](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2022-tfg-david-tapiador/new_blocks/ROS2/motor/MotorROS2_new_format.py) and the [velocity sender](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2022-tfg-david-tapiador/new_blocks/ROS2/motor/Vel_sender_new_format.py), which also have their own new format versions.

I also made the pull requests to update all those blocks (laser, camera and motor) into the VisualCircuit github ^.^
