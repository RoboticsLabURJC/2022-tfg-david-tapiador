This week I ended the VFF project.

The big problem I was facing with the attractive forces really was not that big. The problem was that I was using python's functions "math.cos" and "math.sin" with euler degrees instead of radians, so when I changed them, everything worked as intended.

As we can see in the following video (as a difference with the 19th week which only used repulsive forces) is that now the robot takes the interior path in the turns and not the center of the circuit. This is caused by the attractive forces pulling the robot to the path of the objective and the repulsive forces making it not collide with the walls. Here is the video of everything working!!

Now I'm working on the TFG's index for the final summary.
