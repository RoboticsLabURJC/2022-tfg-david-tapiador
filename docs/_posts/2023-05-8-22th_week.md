Now I think the project is finally done, I've been struggling to find a solution for the arrow problem, but it finally worked.
There were several problems here. First of all, the grid (numpy matrix) leaves the coord 0,0 on the top left corner, which makes harder the rotations of the robot to be applied into the grid as well as the arrows to point correctly to the place where they are actually attracting.

As previously the attractive and repulsive forces where calculated only for the rotation (always using the same linear speed), this implied some blocks to change how they worked. After these got solved, the FSM started working really good!

Here is an example of it going to 3 random coords and then returning to the original coord!

Now that the project is finished, I am starting with the summary. For this, I used a [template from Julio Vega](https://gitlab.etsit.urjc.es/jmvega/plantilla-latex-tfg-tfm/-/tree/master), URCJ's teacher and also one of my degree's teacher.

I'm actually working on some chapters individually, trying to end what I start and not to have much started and nothing finished. I hope it doesn't take too long to end everything :D
