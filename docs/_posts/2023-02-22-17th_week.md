This week I've been experimenting with noVNC and the docker.

Since I already had a "working page" (moreless working xd), I tried to work on a simpler way to launch the docker and all the displays without needing 6 terminals and 10 commands in each.

For this, I developed a bash script that launches all the displays (just the visible thing in the website) and it is [here](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2022-tfg-david-tapiador/blob/main/webpage/launch.sh).

The important thing for this week is to test if the docker works with ROS2 and if it also works with a VisualCircuit project.
I decided to use one of the projects I already had in my repo, in this case the laser with ROS2 project.

So I sended manually the project into the docker and launched everything. As we can see in the video, the measures shown in text in the docker's shell are changing when I move the blocks in the docker's gazebo. This seems to work!!
