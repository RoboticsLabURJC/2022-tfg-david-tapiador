On this third week I continued with the follow_road, but several problems keep appearing. First of all I wanted to thanks Pedro Arias for trying to help me resolve all the problems.
Now the drone takes off correctly, but it didn't respond to the ros topic's messages I sent, so it didnt actually move. The problem here was that the drone was not in "OFFBOARD" mode, so it only followed the "mission" points he had settled before taking off. After I run a [simple python script](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2022-tfg-david-tapiador/blob/main/scripts/drone_offboard_mode.py) to make the drone keep the OFFBOARD mode (it goes back to mission mode if u dont request OFFBOARD mode every 5s), it stayed in this mode and followed the topic velocities, but it tries to return to the takeoff point resulting in some movements like this.
