On this third week I continued with the follow_road, but several problems keep appearing. First of all I wanted to thanks Pedro Arias for trying to help me resolve all the problems.

Now the drone takes off correctly, but it didn't respond to the ros topic's messages I sent, so it didnt actually move. After some config changes, the drone moved, but always tried to go back to the [takeoff point](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2022-tfg-david-tapiador/blob/main/docs/images/drone_error.mp4).

The problem here was that the drone was not in "OFFBOARD" mode. After running a [simple python script](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2022-tfg-david-tapiador/blob/main/scripts/drone_offboard_mode.py) to make the drone keep the OFFBOARD mode (it goes back to mission mode if u dont request OFFBOARD mode every 5s), it stayed in this mode and followed the topic velocities, but it tries to return to the takeoff point resulting in some movements like [this](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2022-tfg-david-tapiador/blob/main/docs/images/drone_error2.mp4).

After all the changes and research, we couldn't find what the problem was, so it remains unresolved. :C

But not everything in this week was as bad as this. I also developed some new applications.

One of them is "flipped", a VisualCircuit block I created my self to rotate and image 90ยบ. My camera has only 15fps (frames per second) so all the frequencies I used are 15, but it works with higher freqs.

Also I used a VisualCircuit block called "object_detector" that uses yolo and darknet to find different objects. Here I found a couple of errors that I fixed and I will also create a new issue involving these errors. Here is a [video](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2022-tfg-david-tapiador/blob/main/docs/images/object_detection.mp4) that shows the "object_detector" block working.
